            "description": "Crop production contributes to climate change via the emission of greenhouse gases (GHGs), primarily from use of synthetic nitrogen fertilisers (SNF) that require considerable amount of fossil energy to produce, and that give rise to soil emissions of nitrous oxide following application. Meanwhile, depletion or enhancement of soil carbon (C) stocks can results in significant emission to, or sequestration from, the atmospheric pool of carbon dioxide (CO2) that influences temperature forcing (and thus climate change). The primary metric proposed for this environmental aspect of crop production is GHG emissions per tonne (Mg) of produce. GHG emissions intensities can be: (i) derived through application of a life cycle assessment (LCA) to specific crop cultivation stages, most simply by using an open source footprint calculator such as the Cool farm Tool (https://coolfarmtool.org/) or AgreCalc (https://www.agrecalc.com/); (ii) obtained from secondary sources, including LCA (e.g. Ecoinvent & AgriFootprint) databases and published food LCA studies (e.g. Poore and Nemecek 2018). Results should be expressed per tonne (Mg) of dry matter (DM) of the main product, to ensure standardized units. This may require knowledge of moisture content at harvest, and possibly also allocation of crop cultivation burdens across multiple co-products (e.g. grain and straw) based on relative economic values. GHG emissions should be aggregated as kg CO2 equivalent based on IPCC (2013) global warming potentials over a 100-year timeframe (GWP100). Changes in soil C stocks may be included in net emissions balances, as per standard reporting guidelines for land use and land use change emissions (BSI 2011; IPCC 2006b). Note that for this and all subsequent environment metrics, harvested products include co-products (e.g. straw) alongside the main product (e.g. grain) harvested from the cropping system.  ",
            "metrics": "The use of an appropriate carbon calculator such as Cool Farm Tool is the 'gold standard' approach to represent GHG emission performance in primary production as per the thresholds set out below, and is necessary for animal systems. However, for cropping systems, where it is not feasible to enter data into a carbon calculator, an alternative approach is to use nitrogen fertiliser application rate as a proxy of GHG emissions. Approximately 80% of crop emissions (up to the farm gate) originate from nitrogen fertiliser manufacture and nitrous oxide emissions that arise in proportion to nitrogen application rates. Thus, it is the single most relevant proxy for pre farm gate GHG emissions. The same thresholds are proposed for this metric as for the energy intensity of primary production indicator. The following scales are provisionally suggested based on range of crop footprint values (Wernet et al. 2016), and may need calibrating."

Through a reduction in requirements for SNF and organic fertilisers, legumes may be associated with lower atmospheric emissions than conventional crops. Given the difficulty of obtaining precise data for the ideal metric of NH3 emission per Mg DM, the primary metric proposed for this environmental aspect of crop production is based on the intensity of activities giving rise to ammonia emissions – primarily mineral and organic fertilizer applications. Information on typical rates of fertilizer application (e.g. fertilizer recommendations) and yields for particular crops (e.g. EuroStat and FAO Stat) can provide a strong indication of the overall GHG- and ammonia- intensities of production. The application of urea and manure provide simpler metrics relating to the likely intensities of ammonia emissions.",

This challenge is likely to be exacerbated by climate change. However, data on water abstraction are often not collated, and here we propose a simple indicator of potential water stress based on irrigation practice. Where no irrigation is needed, water stress induced by cropping is assumed to be minor. Where irrigation is required, practices are differentiated into “advanced” methods that maximise water use efficiency, such as drip irrigation and deficit (control) irrigation, and less efficient (basic) irrigation methods such as flood irrigation and sprinkler irrigation.",

Crucially, if multiple crops are harvested in one year on a particular area of land, then this should be represented within the metric by dividing the area by the fraction of year allocated to the crop in question. For example, if two soybean crops are cultivated within one year in a particular region, then the yield-derived m2 Mg-1 required for each crop may be divided by 2 to produce the final specific time-weighted area (m2.yr Mg-1 DM). This metric provides an indication of land use efficiency and therefore could be used to identify “land sparing” opportunities, or pressures driving agricultural expansion that may ultimately lead to undesirable (indirect) land use change (Searchinger et al. 2018).",

SOM is closely related to biological activity, water retention and general fertility of cropland soils. However, SOM varies considerably depending on factors outside of farmer management practises, including climate and soil type. Here, we propose SOM concentration (FAO 2013) in the topsoil (0-10 cm) of fields producing the assessed crop as a metric of soil quality. This metric applies only to cropland soils, as grassland soils have higher SOM. Often, SOM is reported in terms of soil organic carbon (de Brogniez et al. 2015); typically, SOM is twice the mass of soil organic carbon (IPCC 2006a).",

The metric proposed here is simply the quantity of electricity used to process one tonne (Mg) DM product. For sites processing just one main crop/commodity, total site-level electricity consumption over a given time period can simply be divided by output of processed product over that same time period. For sites processing multiple commodities, site level electricity consumption may be allocated across products based on weight (unless more accurate splits are possible based on known intensities of processing). Similarly, electricity consumption may be allocated across co-products based on e.g. relative mass, gross energy value or economic value (Finkbeiner et al. 2006).

This metric therefore assesses the sustainability of the specific electricity supply.

            "description": "The significant energy inputs required for processing often give rise to GHG emissions via use of fossil fuels as energy carriers. For example, the generation of electricity used in processing, or the direct combustion of natural gas or oil in boilers to generate heat onsite. These emissions are highly variable, depending on the source of energy and the quantities used, which depend on the type of food products being produced. In addition, leakage of refrigerants from cooling systems can contribute significantly to GHG emissions. Whilst the ideal metric for GHG emissions from processing would combine information on energy use and energy source to estimate total GHG emissions, these data are rarely available, and processing covers such as wide range of activities that it is impossible to propose universally applicable thresholds. Thus, a simplified approach is to use the main source of energy (accounting for than 50% of energy inputs) as a proxy for the GHG intensity of energy. Coal and oil are the most GHG-intensive energy sources per MJ, followed by gas, and then renewables as the least GHG-intensive sources of energy per MJ. The GHG intensity of electricity strongly depends on national grid profiles, but it reducing strongly across EU member states in line with various EU policies. Therefore, electricity is proposed as an intermediate GHG-intensive source of energy, unless it can be demonstrated that national grid average electricity generation in the relevant country where processing takes places is less than 0.3 kg CO2 eq. per kWh.",

Emissions of particular concern regarding human health and ecosystem damage include nitrogen oxides (NOx), volatile organic compounds (VOCs) and particulate matter (PM). Solid fuels including coal and wood, and oil, are responsible for much higher emissions of these species than natural gas. If no solid or fossil fuels are combusted, then onsite emissions will be negligible. Use of renewable sources of heat, or use of electricity for heating., can avoid onsite emissions, but may incur upstream emissions. These are almost always much lower owing to better combustion control and abatement technologies for large-scale power generation compared with smaller boilers. Given that these emissions cannot be easily measured in small-scale processing factories, a simple indicator based on the type of fuel combusted onsite is proposed.",

The previous metric addresses the management of waste arising in the processing chain. Packaging waste usually arises at the consumption stage of the value chain, but is heavily influenced by the actions of processors and retailers who package products and specific packaging requirements, respectively. Therefore, this metric places an onus on processors to use renewable (e.g. bioplastic: Álvarez-Chávez et al. 2012) and recycled materials in their packaging.  A subsequent metric, aimed at market actors who determine packaging specifications, relates to the quantity of packaging used.",

The impact of water use is heavily dependent on where it is sourced from, whether or not it is returned to a nearby waterbody in a clean state, and how water stressed the local region is. An ideal indicator for water stress would be the Available Water Remaining method for water foot-printing (Boulay et al. 2018). However, this method involves a considerable amount of data and effort. Therefore, a simple metric of total water used for processing divided by the tonnes of product produced is proposed.",

The distance travelled is therefore not a useful indicator of sustainability, given that e.g. tomatoes imported to the UK in winter have a lower environmental footprint than tomatoes grown in heated greenhouses in the UK (Antonopoulos et al. 2014). The mode of transport strongly influences environmental impact, with air freight generating up to 500 times more CO2 eq. per tonne.km travelled than ocean transport over long distances (DEFRA 2019). Therefore, we propose mode of transport, and local vs global transport, as two important components of environmental sustainability (local supply chains within Europe are likely to be subject to higher levels of environmental regulation than global supply chains). Where products comprise multiple ingredients, this metric relates to the most environmentally intensive mode across any of the ingredients accounting for more than 10% by mass of the final product(s).",

Emissions of particular concern regarding human health and ecosystem damage include nitrogen oxides (NOx), volatile organic compounds (VOCs) and particulate matter (PM). Solid fuels including coal and wood, and oil, are responsible for much higher emissions of these species than natural gas. If no solid or fossil fuels are combusted, then onsite emissions will be negligible. Use of renewable sources of heat, or use of electricity for heating., can avoid onsite emissions, but may incur upstream emissions. These are almost always much lower owing to better combustion control and abatement technologies for large-scale power generation compared with smaller boilers. Given that these emissions cannot be easily measured in small-scale processing factories, a simple indicator based on the type of fuel combusted onsite is proposed.",

Examples of safety net measures are the Financial Instruments (FIs) which were first introduced in the 2000-2006 EU Rural Development Programme (RDP) (EU,2017) to correct market failures/imperfections that give rise to an insufficient funding of areas perceived as too risky by the private sectors and crop insurance policies (USDA, 2011).",
            "metrics": "Yes - Presence of a sufficient number of such instruments capable of maintaining the firm’s capital flow; No – Absence of such instrument."

Food contamination should be avoided; implementing control measures enables the enterprise to prevent and combat any situation that might lead to food contamination. Food safety has a direct impact on consumers’ health, as well as on the employees that are in direct contact with the food ingredients. An integrated approach to ensure food safety requires a strong cooperation by the food industry and chain stakeholders in order to build consumers trust and confidence. The enterprise requires investing in education programmes, preventive measures and adoption of adequate practices. A food safety hazard is a biological, chemical or physical agent in, or condition of, food with the potential to cause an adverse health effect. Some examples include improper use of agricultural chemicals (i.e. insecticides, fungicides, herbicides, fertilizers), metal and rock fragments, the appearance of virus, bacteria and parasites and the use of genetically-modified organisms that have been proven to be harmful.

Quality standards are also important for forest products, including wood products and non-wood products. For storage and transportation, quality refers also to cleanliness and packing that guarantee quality assurance within the supply chain. Food standards are a body of rules or legislation defining certain criteria, such as composition, appearance, freshness, source, sanitation, purity, which food must fulfil to be suitable for distribution or sale. The enterprise implements quality control measures to ensure that the expected level of quality of the product and nutritional standards are met. Product quality is an important component to leverage the enterprise’ market positioning and growth. Its competitive advantage lays predominately in two main factors: the quality of the product and its price. Achieving high-quality levels and the highest nutritional standards might benefit considerably the enterprise’ business growth. Even though each product might require to meet specific nutritional standards, there are some that might be recommended across the food chain, for instance: level of calories based on the ranges defined by the Dietary Reference Intakes (DRIs), low content of saturated and trans fat, no added sugar, low content of additives, rich in fiber, minerals, vitamins and proteins. The national departments or ministries of health, education or agriculture tend to define and recommend specific nutritional standards for each product that the enterprise should know to ensure its compliance (Cardello, 1995; FAO, 2013).",

To measure food safety:|Review the quality control report referred to the total volume of production for a given period.|Check whether the quality control report observes the required standards, according to the norms that the product needs to meet.|Calculate the share of the volume of production that has successfully passed the quality control."

Increasingly, consumers are demanding certification, to the extent that certified agriculture products are increasing their market share at significant rates. Consumers are also becoming wary of self-certification schemes, where producers or marketers create independent “certification” by awarding themselves a brand which mimics independent certification. By contrast, certified sustainable production employs independent or collaborative verification systems, with transparent auditable protocols. Certified production might include organic standards, both third party and participatory guarantee systems, HACCP food safety systems, Fairtrade, Rainforest Alliance, Forest Stewardship Council, Marine Stewardship Council, Aquaculture Stewardship Council, or other voluntary sustainability standards. Certification standards, which are closely associated with large producers and marketers, are subject of some controversy, as to who’s interests are given primacy in decisions taken (FAO, 2013; McGee, 2015).",

This might include the following tasks: conduct a risk analysis to identify all possible hazards; identify any steps in the production process that are critical to the safety of food; implement effective procedures to ensure as appropriate food safety by eliminating or isolating hazards; conduct a monitoring and evaluation of these procedures to ensure their effectiveness to avoid any food contamination. Food contamination should be avoided; implementing control measures enables the enterprise to prevent and combat any situation that might lead to food contamination. Food safety has a direct impact on consumers’ health, as well as on the employees that are in direct contact with the food ingredients. An integrated approach to ensure food safety requires a strong cooperation by the food industry and chain stakeholders in order to build consumers trust and confidence. The enterprise requires investing in education programmes, preventive measures and adoption of adequate practices. A food safety hazard is a biological, chemical or physical agent in, or condition of, food with the potential to cause an adverse health effect. Some examples include improper use of agricultural chemicals (i.e. insecticides, fungicides, herbicides, fertilizers), metal and rock fragments, the appearance of virus, bacteria and parasites and the use of genetically-modified organisms that have been proven to be harmful.

Food standards are a body of rules or legislation defining certain criteria, such as composition, appearance, freshness, source, sanitation, purity, which food must fulfil to be suitable for distribution or sale. The enterprise implements quality control measures to ensure that the expected level of quality of the product and nutritional standards are met. Product quality is an important component to leverage the enterprise’ market positioning and growth. Its competitive advantage lays predominately in two main factors: the quality of the product and its price. Achieving high-quality levels and the highest nutritional standards might benefit considerably the enterprise’ business growth. Even though each product might require to meet specific nutritional standards, there are some that might be recommended across the food chain, for instance: level of calories based on the ranges defined by the Dietary Reference Intakes (DRIs), low content of saturated and trans fat, no added sugar, low content of additives, rich in fiber, minerals, vitamins and proteins. The national departments or ministries of health, education or agriculture tend to define and recommend specific nutritional standards for each product that the enterprise should know to ensure its compliance (Cardello, 1995; FAO, 2013).",

It is a growing field and is gaining credibility, as very large and powerful enterprises are subscribing to it, and investing in ensuring sustainable production across the supply chain. Increasingly, consumers are demanding certification, to the extent that certified agriculture products are increasing their market share at significant rates. Consumers are also becoming wary of self-certification schemes, where producers or marketers create independent “certification” by awarding themselves a brand which mimics independent certification. By contrast, certified sustainable production employs independent or collaborative verification systems, with transparent auditable protocols. Certified production might include organic standards, both third party and participatory guarantee systems, HACCP food safety systems, Fairtrade, Rainforest Alliance, Forest Stewardship Council, Marine Stewardship Council, Aquaculture Stewardship Council, or other voluntary sustainability standards. Certification standards, which are closely associated with large producers and marketers, are subject of some controversy, as to who’s interests are given primacy in decisions taken (FAO, 2013; McGee, 2015).",

According to the Codex Alimentarius Commission (COD EX STAN 1-1985), “Labeling means any written, printed or graphic matter that is present on the label, accompanies the food, or is displayed near the food, including that for the purpose of promoting its sale or disposal.” Information usually provides details on the content and composition of products but also particular aspects of the product, such as its origin, or its production method, including whether it has been produced using a certified organic production or other methods. Some foodstuffs, such as those containing genetically modified organisms or allergenic substances, especially foods intended for infants or even various beverages, are subject to specific regulations. Labelling may also identify value-based systems, such as whether goods have been produced using a certified fair trade system. Labelling of certain non-food products must also contain particular information such as toxicity, hazard and flammability, to guarantee their safe use and allow consumers to exercise real choice. In addition, the packaging of foodstuffs must adhere to production criteria to avoid contaminating food products with both food and nonfood contaminants. Labelling must be genuine, and in the best systems, this is independently verified, such as an organic certification or fair trade certificate. Therefore, labelling and claims vary from ethical and nutritional, through safety and production process characteristics and can include the mundane, such as origin through to whether the food is the result of genetic engineering. The standard is that labels must be clear, honest and verifiable (FAO, 2013; Boström et al., 2008).",
            "metrics": "For mandatory labeling as required in the country of sale, 100% of compliance is expected. However, where an enterprise markets to numerous jurisdictions, the highest standard  required by any jurisdiction should be applied to all. Where an enterprise has adopted labeling and information beyond the minimum standard, this should be noted and again 100% compliance is expected, as anything less is worse than  no labeling at all.|Measurement:|All product labeling is audited against legally required code in the country in which it is sold.|All voluntary claims (e.g. fair trade, organic) are checked against the independent certifier statement.|Where content and nutritional claims are made, these are routinely independently audited.|Labeling codes used are included in the enterprise quality management documentation and any variance from the code is documented and reported internally."

The Codex Alimentarius Commission (COD EX STAN 1-1985) defines traceability as “the ability to follow the movement of a food through specified stage(s) of production, processing and distribution”. The “ability to follow the movement” refers to tracing both directions: trace forward in the food chain and trace backward in the food chain. Furthermore, “movement” can relate to the origin of the materials, processing history or distribution. Traceability systems could be composed of rules and documented procedures, organizational structures, processes and management resources (i.e. personnel, financial resources, equipment, information technologies), regulations and training. A traceability system can also use information system technologies for electronic data entry and database management systems. Traceability systems improve management of risks related to food safety, guarantees products authenticity and give reliable information to customers. New legal requirements in many developed and developing countries increase pressure on exporting countries to comply with traceability requirements and especially, with those included in the World Trade Organization agreements, to justify sanitary or phytosanitary objectives. Additionally, traceability is a requirement in all B2B voluntary certifiable standards in good agricultural and manufacturing practices, including  HACC P principles. There are two main international standards and guidelines that regulate the establishment and operation of a traceability system: ISO 9001: 2000, a standard for quality management and quality assurance; and ISO 22000: 2005, a standard for food safety and management systems. In the case of forest products, it is important to track the chain of custody of all types of products to ensure that they originated from sustainably managed forests verifiable (Moe, 2008; FAO, 2013).",

This might include the following tasks: conduct a risk analysis to identify all possible hazards; identify any steps in the production process that are critical to the safety of food; implement effective procedures to ensure as appropriate food safety by eliminating or isolating hazards; conduct a monitoring and evaluation of these procedures to ensure their effectiveness to avoid any food contamination. Food contamination should be avoided; implementing control measures enables the enterprise to prevent and combat any situation that might lead to food contamination. Food safety has a direct impact on consumers’ health, as well as on the employees that are in direct contact with the food ingredients. An integrated approach to ensure food safety requires a strong cooperation by the food industry and chain stakeholders in order to build consumers trust and confidence. The enterprise requires investing in education programmes, preventive measures and adoption of adequate practices. A food safety hazard is a biological, chemical or physical agent in, or condition of, food with the potential to cause an adverse health effect. Some examples include improper use of agricultural chemicals (i.e. insecticides, fungicides, herbicides, fertilizers), metal and rock fragments, the appearance of virus, bacteria and parasites and the use of genetically-modified organisms that have been proven to be harmful.

Food contamination should be avoided; implementing control measures enables the enterprise to prevent and combat any situation that might lead to food contamination. Food safety has a direct impact on consumers’ health, as well as on the employees that are in direct contact with the food ingredients. An integrated approach to ensure food safety requires a strong cooperation by the food industry and chain stakeholders in order to build consumers trust and confidence. The enterprise requires investing in education programmes, preventive measures and adoption of adequate practices. A food safety hazard is a biological, chemical or physical agent in, or condition of, food with the potential to cause an adverse health effect. Some examples include improper use of agricultural chemicals (i.e. insecticides, fungicides, herbicides, fertilizers), metal and rock fragments, the appearance of virus, bacteria and parasites and the use of genetically-modified organisms that have been proven to be harmful.

Food standards are a body of rules or legislation defining certain criteria, such as composition, appearance, freshness, source, sanitation, purity, which food must fulfil to be suitable for distribution or sale. The enterprise implements quality control measures to ensure that the expected level of quality of the product and nutritional standards are met. Product quality is an important component to leverage the enterprise’ market positioning and growth. Its competitive advantage lays predominately in two main factors: the quality of the product and its price. Achieving high-quality levels and the highest nutritional standards might benefit considerably the enterprise’ business growth. Even though each product might require to meet specific nutritional standards, there are some that might be recommended across the food chain, for instance: level of calories based on the ranges defined by the Dietary Reference Intakes (DRIs), low content of saturated and trans fat, no added sugar, low content of additives, rich in fiber, minerals, vitamins and proteins. The national departments or ministries of health, education or agriculture tend to define and recommend specific nutritional standards for each product that the enterprise should know to ensure its compliance (Cardello, 1995; FAO, 2013).",

By contrast, certified sustainable production employs independent or collaborative verification systems, with transparent auditable protocols. Certified production might include organic standards, both third party and participatory guarantee systems, HACCP food safety systems, Fairtrade, Rainforest Alliance, Forest Stewardship Council, Marine Stewardship Council, Aquaculture Stewardship Council, or other voluntary sustainability standards.

            "description": "Product labelling is an essential part of transparent accountability to consumers. According to the Codex Alimentarius Commission (COD EX STAN 1-1985), “Labeling means any written, printed or graphic matter that is present on the label, accompanies the food, or is displayed near the food, including that for the purpose of promoting its sale or disposal.” Information usually provides details on the content and composition of products but also particular aspects of the product, such as its origin, or its production method, including whether it has been produced using a certified organic production or other methods. Some foodstuffs, such as those containing genetically modified organisms or allergenic substances, especially foods intended for infants or even various beverages, are subject to specific regulations. Labelling may also identify value-based systems, such as whether goods have been produced using a certified fair trade system. Labelling of certain non-food products must also contain particular information such as toxicity, hazard and flammability, to guarantee their safe use and allow consumers to exercise real choice. In addition, the packaging of foodstuffs must adhere to production criteria to avoid contaminating food products with both food and nonfood contaminants. Labelling must be genuine, and in the best systems, this is independently verified, such as an organic certification or fair trade certificate. Therefore, labelling and claims vary from ethical and nutritional, through safety and production process characteristics and can include the mundane, such as origin through to whether the food is the result of genetic engineering. The standard is that labels must be clear, honest and verifiable (FAO, 2013; Boström et al., 2008).",
            "metrics": "For mandatory labeling as required in the country of sale, 100% of compliance is expected. However, where an enterprise markets to numerous jurisdictions, the highest standard  required by any jurisdiction should be applied to all. Where an enterprise has adopted labeling and information beyond the minimum standard, this should be noted and again 100% compliance is expected, as anything less is worse than  no labeling at all.|Measurement:|All product labeling is audited against legally required code in the country in which it is sold.|All voluntary claims (e.g. fair trade, organic) are checked against the independent certifier statement.|Where content and nutritional claims are made, these are routinely independently audited.|Labeling codes used are included in the enterprise quality management documentation and any variance from the code is documented and reported internally."

            "description": "A traceability system is a series of mechanisms and procedures that ensure traceability over all stages of the food chain so that products can be easily and correctly identified and recalled. The Codex Alimentarius Commission (COD EX STAN 1-1985) defines traceability as “the ability to follow the movement of a food through specified stage(s) of production, processing and distribution”. The “ability to follow the movement” refers to tracing both directions: trace forward in the food chain and trace backward in the food chain. Furthermore, “movement” can relate to the origin of the materials, processing history or distribution. Traceability systems could be composed of rules and documented procedures, organizational structures, processes and management resources (i.e. personnel, financial resources, equipment, information technologies), regulations and training. A traceability system can also use information system technologies for electronic data entry and database management systems. Traceability systems improve management of risks related to food safety, guarantees products authenticity and give reliable information to customers. New legal requirements in many developed and developing countries increase pressure on exporting countries to comply with traceability requirements and especially, with those included in the World Trade Organization agreements, to justify sanitary or phytosanitary objectives. Additionally, traceability is a requirement in all B2B voluntary certifiable standards in good agricultural and manufacturing practices, including  HACC P principles. There are two main international standards and guidelines that regulate the establishment and operation of a traceability system: ISO 9001: 2000, a standard for quality management and quality assurance; and ISO 22000: 2005, a standard for food safety and management systems. In the case of forest products, it is important to track the chain of custody of all types of products to ensure that they originated from sustainably managed forests verifiable (Moe, 2008; FAO, 2013).",

There has been recent focus in the literature on food redistribution between different agents along the supply chain, mostly in the hospitality and retail sector using different transformative mechanisms and via a number of channels from the more traditional to online collaborative platforms and other ICT-enabled modes (Falcone P.M., Imbert E. 2017, Bringing a Sharing Economy Approach into the Food Sector: The Potential of Food Sharing for Reducing Food Waste. In: Morone P., Papendiek F., Tartiu V. (eds) Food Waste Reduction and Valorisation, Springer). Food redistribution has not only economic and environmental benefits but also food security and social impacts, and thus any approach to redistribution has to be aligned with the social justice context. Food surplus redistribution may lead to social inclusion benefits and be central to the nexus of waste reduction, social inclusion, and community engagement (Schanes, K. and Stagl, S. 2018.

            "description": "Food price is the amount of money charged for a food product. Technically, the price of food is the sum of all the values that a customer gives up to gain the benefits of having or using the food in question. Thus, consumers exchange a certain value for having or using the product. That value is called price. Price has been the major factor affecting buyer choice. However, in recent decades, non-price factors (e.g., the origin and the healthiness of the food) have gained increasing importance. Food prices are affected by several factors such as the cost of inputs, labour, transport, processing, marketing, weather, market speculation, and food demand (Köster, 2009; Swinnen, 2011).",
            "metrics": "Two main methods are used to figure out what price to attach to each unit of a food product: competition-based pricing and cost-based pricing. Competition-based pricing is a pricing method that makes use of competitors' prices for the same or similar product as a basis in setting a price. The business may sell its product at a price above or below such a benchmark. Setting a price above the benchmark will result in higher profit per unit but may also result in fewer units sold, as customers would prefer products with lower prices. On the other hand, setting a price below the benchmark might result in more units sold but will cause less profit per unit. The cost-based pricing method consists of adding the direct material cost, the direct labour cost, and overhead to determine what it costs the company to offer the product or service. Then, a markup percentage is added to the total cost to determine the selling price. This markup percentage is profit (Hinterhuber, 2008; Johansson et al., 2012)."

            "description": "Price promotion is a sales’ promotion technique, wherein the firm reduces the price of a product drastically, but for a short period. Companies adopt several promotional pricing schemes such as special-event pricing, cash rebates, warranties and service contracts, and psychological discounting. Special-event pricing consists in offering discounts and rebates on festivals, during the off-seasons with the intention to pull as many customers as possible. Cash rebates consist in offering the cash rebates on their items if purchased in a particular time period. In the case of loss-leader pricing, big retailers reduce the price of a well-known brand with the intention to have additional store traffic. Through this strategy, the retailers try to compensate for their margin loss from the additional sales achieved from additional customers. Warranties and service contracts consist in offering extended warranties and free services of the product to the customers. Finally, under psychological discounting, the companies artificially set the high price of the product and then offer it at substantial savings (Kendrick, 1998; Kaser, 2012).",
            "metrics": "There are different techniques to measure the effectiveness of price promotions (Palazon and Delgado‐Ballester, 2009; Hawkes, 2009):|1) Compare the sales and gross margins for the promoted product before the promotional period, during the promotional period, and after the promotional period.|2)Compare the overall average order size and the lines per order during the promotion periods to those same metrics during non-promotion periods.|3) Compare the total sales per day of all items during promotional periods (including the items not promoted), to the total sales per day of all items during non-promotional periods.|4) Compare the results for the various promotions against each other. Rank which promotions provided the best sales and gross margin lift for the company. Compare the results against those in prior years to see if the trends are favourable, or if certain promotional activities are getting stale.|5) Compare the added gross margins generated by each promotion, to the underlying incremental cost of each promotion, to determine the overall net profit generated by each program."

It is an indicator of household food security because it is widely documented that the poorer and more vulnerable a household, the larger the share of household income spent on food. This observation is known as Engel's law, which demonstrates that as incomes rise, both within a country and across countries, expenditure on food increases but expenditure on other things increases even more, so that the share of total income spent on food declines. Given this observation, the indicator is especially helpful to understand the impact of food price fluctuations on both the quality and quantity of household (Humphries et al., 2017; Venn et al., 2018).",
            "metrics": "Data on food expenditure can be obtained from a limited number of sources, some are open access and others are available upon request (e.g., country’s National Bureau of Statistics).|1) Household surveys data (e.g., Living Costs and Food Survey in the UK). In the survey, households are asked to provide data, or estimates, of the amounts they spend on consumption goods and services and for other purposes over a given period. They are also called Household consumption surveys or Household budget surveys. This type of survey is possibly the most important source of information on poverty, food security, and nutrition outcomes at national, sub-national and household level (Grosh and Glewwe, 2000).|2) Scanner data come from two types of data collections. (1) Point-of-sale (retail) collections which use the universal product code (UPC) of products sold at retail checkout counters to identify products and quantities sold and their prices. (2) Household scanner panels, which are usually random samples of households in which household members are asked to scan in the UPC of the items they have purchased, using scanners provided to them (Baron and Lock, 1995)."

            "description": "Willingness to pay refers to the maximum price at or below which a consumer will buy one unit of the product labelled as healthy. To be labelled as healthy, the food must be low in sugar, saturated fat, and salt.  It must also provide at least 10 per cent of one or more of vitamins A or C, iron, calcium, protein, or fibre. It also popular in research papers to report the price premium for healthy food products. The price premium is computed as the difference between the willingness to pay for a food product labelled as healthy and its counterpart that is not labelled as healthy (Grunert et al., 2007; Gao and Schroeder, 2009).",
            "metrics": "Willingness to pay is generally expressed as the amount of money per unit of product. Data on consumers’ willingness to pay for healthy food are generally collected using value-elicitation methods (e.g., contingent valuation, experimental auctions) or preference-elicitation methods (e.g., discrete choice experiment, ranking conjoint analysis, best-worst mechanism). In the value-elicitation methods, consumers are directly asked to report their maximum willingness to pay for the food product labelled as healthy. In preference-elicitation methods, consumers are presented with a set of alternatives of the same food product that are described in terms of,e.g., their nutritional content and price; and are asked to indicate the alternative they prefer most (or rank the alternatives from the most to the least preferred). Then, a choice model is used to estimate consumers’ marginal utility for the health label and the price. Finally, consumers’ average willingness to pay is computed as the negative of the ratio of the marginal utility for the health label divided by the marginal utility for the price (Ryan et al, 2007)."

            "description": "Willingness to pay for convenience food refers to the maximum price at or below which a consumer will buy one unit of food that is easier to prepare and consume compared with its conventional counterpart. Convenience foods are appealing to people who have poor cooking skills or have no time to search and execute recipes from scratch. Convenience food includes a range of products like noodles, soup, frozen vegetables, casserole mixes, dessert mixes and yoghurts.  To measure the WTP for convenience, first, the attribute convenience of the studied food product needs to be defined. Then, two products one with the attribute convenience and one without this attribute should be identified and valued. The price premium for convenience is the difference between the willingness to pay for the food with the attribute convenience and the food without this attribute (e.g., Ready to eat lasagne versus frozen and not cooked lasagne) (Lyly et al., 2007; Ikiz et al., 2018).",
            "metrics": "Willingness to pay is generally expressed as the amount of money per unit of product. Data on consumers’ willingness to pay for convenience food are generally collected using value-elicitation methods (e.g., contingent valuation, experimental auctions) or preference-elicitation methods (e.g., discrete choice experiment, ranking conjoint analysis, best-worst mechanism). In the value-elicitation methods, consumers are directly asked to report their maximum willingness to pay for the convenience food of interest.  In preference-elicitation methods, consumers are presented with a set of different alternatives of a food product. The alternatives are described in terms of,e.g., convenience level and price; and are asked to indicate the alternative they prefer most (or rank the alternatives from the most to the least preferred). Then, a choice model is used to estimate consumers’ marginal utility for the attribute convenience and the price. Finally, consumers’ average willingness to pay is computed as the negative of the ratio of the marginal utility for the attribute convenience divided by the marginal utility for the price (Hensher et al., 2015; Grunert et al., 2009)."

            "description": "Food product information such as information on the origin of the product, nutritional content, and portion sizes is critical to help consumers make confident and informed food choices. Food labels are commonly used to communicate information about the characteristics of food products. Labelling requirements vary across countries. For example, in the UK, mandatory labelling requirements for all packaged foods are as follows (Food Standard Agency, 2018; European Commission, 2018):|name of the food|list of ingredients|ingredients or processing aids causing allergies or intolerances that are stated in the 14 Allergens|quantity of certain ingredients or categories of ingredients|date of minimum durability or the 'use by' date|special storage conditions and/or conditions of use|name or business name and address of the food business operator|country of origin or place of provenance|instructions for use where it would be difficult to make appropriate use of the food in the absence of such instructions|the alcohol strength by volume for beverages containing more than 1.2 % of alcohol, by volume|nutritional declaration|In the case of unpackaged food products, producers and marketers do not have to label their food in the same way that manufacturers and sellers of packaged food businesses do. However, the producers and marketers of non-prepacked food products must provide consumers with information on allergen and intolerance information (Food Standard Agency, 2018; European Commission, 2018).",
            "metrics": "There is an extensive literature in economics and marketing on the effect of product information on consumers’ preferences and demand. Both stated- and revealed-preference methods were used to measure this effect. Contingent valuation, choice experiment, and experimental auctions have been the most commonly used stated-preference methods to investigate the effect of providing consumers with information on products’ characteristics such as healthiness, sustainability, origin, and price (Akaichi et al., 2017, 2019). Revealed-preference methods, such as scanner data and household survey data, were also used to assess the effect on consumers’ purchases of branding, retailers’ promotions and other marketing strategies (Revoredo et al., 2018; Rajavi et al., 2019)."

While on their own they may not necessarily lead to behavioural change, it has been acknowledged that in conjunction with other behavioural determinants, they may have a significant impact on behaviour. Consumers are not always aware of the attributes of the food they consume and increasing awareness through well-targeted information-based tools may lead to change in consumption patterns and correction of perceived barriers to consumption.  Such barriers for instance in the case of legumes include lack of preparation and cooking knowledge, lack of knowledge of the health and environmental benefits, availability of convenience products (legume based processed foods). Improved access to information through e.g.  cooking demonstrations, recipe ideas, educational advice, clear dietary guidance at the national level will help highlight the nutritional profile of legumes within the overall dietary pattern (Figueira, N.; Curtain, F.; Beck, E.; Grafenauer, S.

In the case of legumes, consumption has been higher in food cultures such as Mexican (refried kidney beans), Indian (dhal and pappadums) , Mediterranean (navy bean soup), Middle Eastern (falafel and hummus), and overall in the Caribbean, tropical Latin America, South Asia, western and eastern sub-Saharan Africa, where legume dishes are a traditional component of the food culture. This has largely been due to the high cost and limited availability of meat but also due to religious beliefs in some of these countries. In some northern European cultures, vegetable proteins are perceived as the protein of the poor and therefore they would be unlikely to feature as main ingredients as part of meals on social occasions. In Europe legumes are associated with rural heritage and ethnic foods more likely originating from Southern countries. Exposure to new cultures through e.g. travel and public and media interest in cuisines and dishes from other parts of the world may affect perceptions of cultural suitability (Figueira, N.; Curtain, F.; Beck, E.; Grafenauer, S.

            "description": "Taxes and bans are tools used by governments to discourage the production of and/or the demand for food products with undesirable attributes (e.g., unhealthy foods, non-ethical products and farming practices). Food tax is a surcharge, generally, applied to food products whose consumptions has negatives externalities (e.g., obesity, pollution, addiction). The food tax helps to decrease the consumption of food products with undesirable attributes by increasing their prices.  Furthermore, the money raised through food taxes is generally used by the government to pay for the social cost caused by the consumption of the taxed food. Fat and sugar taxes are among the well-known food taxes that were applied to encourage healthy choices (Bertail and Nichèle, 2010); 2010; Escobar et al., 2013). Bans constitute another tool used by governments to stop the use of farming and processing practices that were proven to have negatives externalities on the public, farm animals, and the environment. For example, bans, such as banning the use of gestation crate (pigs), battery cages (hens), and castration (lamb), were used in the EU to improve the welfare of animals raised in modern EU farms. The trans-fat ban is another example of the use of bans to reduce the consumption of food products with unhealthy attributes. In fact, by the mid-2000s, it was clear beyond doubt that trans-fats increase the risk of coronary heart disease. Denmark banned partially hydrogenated oils in 2003, and several other countries followed suit; in the United States, New York City passed such a ban for restaurant foods in 2006, and the state of California did the same in 2008 (Downs et al., 2013).",
            "metrics": "Demand analysis has been commonly used to assess the effect of taxes on the demand for the taxed food products. Price elasticity is the main output of demand analysis. It measures the percentage change in the demand of the studied product following one per cent change in its price. For example, if the price elasticity of a product A is equal to -2.5, this suggests that an increase in the price of product A by 1% will lead to a decrease in it demand by 2.5%. This also implies that if the price of product A increases by, for example, 10% following the application of a tax, its demand will decrease by 25% (=2.5*10%). There are two types of price elasticity: own-price elasticity and cross-price elasticity. While the own-price elasticity measures the sensitivity of demand for product A to a change in its price, the cross-price elasticity measures the change in the demand for product A to a change in the price of product B. Information on cross-price elasticity is useful to assess how taxing a food product will affect its substitutes and complementary products. For instance, taxing soft drinks may decrease its consumption but may also increase the demand for juice, if juice and soft drinks are complementary products (Gramer et al., 2001; Lin et al., 2011)."

            "description": "They are generally financial incentives given by the government to individuals or businesses in the form of cash, grants, or tax breaks with the aim of keeping the prices of food products low for people to be able to afford them and also to encourage their production in the first place. Subsidies are the most popular income support policy (Callan et al., 1998; Schwartz and Clements, 1999). There are at least four types of subsidies. 1. Production subsidy is provided to encourage the production and consumption of a product. In order for manufacturers to increase their production output, the government compensates for some of its parts to lessen their expense while increasing their output. As a result, production and consumption grow, but the price remains the same. The drawback of such an incentive though is that it promotes overproduction and incurs the cost for product storage. 2. Consumption subsidy happens when the government offsets the costs of food, education, healthcare, and water.  3. Export subsidy consists of encouraging exports by subsidising the cost. However, this can be easily abused, especially, by exporters who exaggerate the prices of their goods so that they receive a larger incentive, eventually raising their profits at the expense of the government’s spending. 4. Employment subsidy is given by the government to companies and organisations in order to enable them to provide more job opportunities. Perhaps the most popular in the EU is the Common Agricultural Policy CAP, which is a system of subsidies paid to EU farmers. Its main purposes are to guarantee minimum levels of production so that Europeans have enough food to eat and to ensure a fair standard of living for those dependent on agriculture (Gray, 2000). In developing countries, income support policies are heavily used to reduce food insecurity and malnutrition. Maize, rice, wheat, sugar, and cooking oil are the most subsidised food products in developing countries (Besley and Kanbur, 1988). There is an increasing body of literature on the negative effect of the use of subsidies. It seems that the use of subsidies harms the environment, distorts trade, and benefits those in society who do not require support (Rivas, 2003).",
            "metrics": "Several approaches have been proposed to measure the effect of income support policies (see for example, Cerulli (2010)). As aforementioned, one of the main objectives of income support policies is to increase (directly or indirectly) individuals’ income. An easy way to assess the sensitivity of the demand for food products to a change in consumer income is to estimate the income elasticities of these products. The income elasticity measures the percentage change in the demand for a product following a change in consumer income. For example, if the income elasticity of fruit and vegetables is equal to 1.6, this implies that an increase of consumer income by 1% will increase the consumption of fruit and vegetables by 1.6% (Gramer et al., 2001; Haque, 2006)."
