                    "Crop production contributes to climate change via the emission of greenhouse gases (GHGs), primarily from use of synthetic nitrogen fertilisers (SNF) that require considerable amount of fossil energy to produce, and that give rise to soil emissions of nitrous oxide following application. Meanwhile, depletion or enhancement of soil carbon (C) stocks can results in significant emission to, or sequestration from, the atmospheric pool of carbon dioxide (CO2) that influences temperature forcing (and thus climate change). The primary metric proposed for this environmental aspect of crop production is GHG emissions per tonne (Mg) of produce. GHG emissions intensities can be: (i) derived through application of a life cycle assessment (LCA) to specific crop cultivation stages, most simply by using an open source footprint calculator such as the Cool farm Tool (https://coolfarmtool.org/) or AgreCalc (https://www.agrecalc.com/); (ii) obtained from secondary sources, including LCA (e.g. Ecoinvent & AgriFootprint) databases and published food LCA studies (e.g. Poore and Nemecek 2018). Results should be expressed per tonne (Mg) of dry matter (DM) of the main product, to ensure standardized units. This may require knowledge of moisture content at harvest, and possibly also allocation of crop cultivation burdens across multiple co-products (e.g. grain and straw) based on relative economic values. GHG emissions should be aggregated as kg CO2 equivalent based on IPCC (2013) global warming potentials over a 100-year timeframe (GWP100). Changes in soil C stocks may be included in net emissions balances, as per standard reporting guidelines for land use and land use change emissions (BSI 2011; IPCC 2006b). Note that for this and all subsequent environment metrics, harvested products include co-products (e.g. straw) alongside the main product (e.g. grain) harvested from the cropping system.  "

                    "The use of an appropriate carbon calculator such as Cool Farm Tool is the 'gold standard' approach to represent GHG emission performance in primary production as per the thresholds set out below, and is necessary for animal systems. However, for cropping systems, where it is not feasible to enter data into a carbon calculator, an alternative approach is to use nitrogen fertiliser application rate as a proxy of GHG emissions. Approximately 80% of crop emissions (up to the farm gate) originate from nitrogen fertiliser manufacture and nitrous oxide emissions that arise in proportion to nitrogen application rates. Thus, it is the single most relevant proxy for pre farm gate GHG emissions. The same thresholds are proposed for this metric as for the energy intensity of primary production indicator. The following scales are provisionally suggested based on range of crop footprint values (Wernet et al. 2016), and may need calibrating."

Through a reduction in requirements for SNF and organic fertilisers, legumes may be associated with lower atmospheric emissions than conventional crops. Given the difficulty of obtaining precise data for the ideal metric of NH3 emission per Mg DM, the primary metric proposed for this environmental aspect of crop production is based on the intensity of activities giving rise to ammonia emissions – primarily mineral and organic fertilizer applications. Information on typical rates of fertilizer application (e.g. fertilizer recommendations) and yields for particular crops (e.g. EuroStat and FAO Stat) can provide a strong indication of the overall GHG- and ammonia- intensities of production. The application of urea and manure provide simpler metrics relating to the likely intensities of ammonia emissions."

Crucially, if multiple crops are harvested in one year on a particular area of land, then this should be represented within the metric by dividing the area by the fraction of year allocated to the crop in question. For example, if two soybean crops are cultivated within one year in a particular region, then the yield-derived m2 Mg-1 required for each crop may be divided by 2 to produce the final specific time-weighted area (m2.yr Mg-1 DM). This metric provides an indication of land use efficiency and therefore could be used to identify “land sparing” opportunities, or pressures driving agricultural expansion that may ultimately lead to undesirable (indirect) land use change (Searchinger et al. 2018)."

This metric applies only to cropland soils, as grassland soils have higher SOM.

The metric proposed here is simply the quantity of electricity used to process one tonne (Mg) DM product. For sites processing just one main crop/commodity, total site-level electricity consumption over a given time period can simply be divided by output of processed product over that same time period. For sites processing multiple commodities, site level electricity consumption may be allocated across products based on weight (unless more accurate splits are possible based on known intensities of processing).

Whilst the ideal metric for GHG emissions from processing would combine information on energy use and energy source to estimate total GHG emissions, these data are rarely available, and processing covers such as wide range of activities that it is impossible to propose universally applicable thresholds. Thus, a simplified approach is to use the main source of energy (accounting for than 50% of energy inputs) as a proxy for the GHG intensity of energy. Coal and oil are the most GHG-intensive energy sources per MJ, followed by gas, and then renewables as the least GHG-intensive sources of energy per MJ. The GHG intensity of electricity strongly depends on national grid profiles, but it reducing strongly across EU member states in line with various EU policies. Therefore, electricity is proposed as an intermediate GHG-intensive source of energy, unless it can be demonstrated that national grid average electricity generation in the relevant country where processing takes places is less than 0.3 kg CO2 eq. per kWh."

Emissions of particular concern regarding human health and ecosystem damage include nitrogen oxides (NOx), volatile organic compounds (VOCs) and particulate matter (PM). Solid fuels including coal and wood, and oil, are responsible for much higher emissions of these species than natural gas. If no solid or fossil fuels are combusted, then onsite emissions will be negligible. Use of renewable sources of heat, or use of electricity for heating., can avoid onsite emissions, but may incur upstream emissions. These are almost always much lower owing to better combustion control and abatement technologies for large-scale power generation compared with smaller boilers. Given that these emissions cannot be easily measured in small-scale processing factories, a simple indicator based on the type of fuel combusted onsite is proposed."

The distance travelled is therefore not a useful indicator of sustainability, given that e.g. tomatoes imported to the UK in winter have a lower environmental footprint than tomatoes grown in heated greenhouses in the UK (Antonopoulos et al. 2014).

Emissions of particular concern regarding human health and ecosystem damage include nitrogen oxides (NOx), volatile organic compounds (VOCs) and particulate matter (PM). Solid fuels including coal and wood, and oil, are responsible for much higher emissions of these species than natural gas. If no solid or fossil fuels are combusted, then onsite emissions will be negligible. Use of renewable sources of heat, or use of electricity for heating., can avoid onsite emissions, but may incur upstream emissions. These are almost always much lower owing to better combustion control and abatement technologies for large-scale power generation compared with smaller boilers. Given that these emissions cannot be easily measured in small-scale processing factories, a simple indicator based on the type of fuel combusted onsite is proposed."

Food contamination should be avoided; implementing control measures enables the enterprise to prevent and combat any situation that might lead to food contamination. Food safety has a direct impact on consumers’ health, as well as on the employees that are in direct contact with the food ingredients. An integrated approach to ensure food safety requires a strong cooperation by the food industry and chain stakeholders in order to build consumers trust and confidence. The enterprise requires investing in education programmes, preventive measures and adoption of adequate practices. A food safety hazard is a biological, chemical or physical agent in, or condition of, food with the potential to cause an adverse health effect. Some examples include improper use of agricultural chemicals (i.e. insecticides, fungicides, herbicides, fertilizers), metal and rock fragments, the appearance of virus, bacteria and parasites and the use of genetically-modified organisms that have been proven to be harmful.

Quality standards are also important for forest products, including wood products and non-wood products. For storage and transportation, quality refers also to cleanliness and packing that guarantee quality assurance within the supply chain. Food standards are a body of rules or legislation defining certain criteria, such as composition, appearance, freshness, source, sanitation, purity, which food must fulfil to be suitable for distribution or sale. The enterprise implements quality control measures to ensure that the expected level of quality of the product and nutritional standards are met. Product quality is an important component to leverage the enterprise’ market positioning and growth. Its competitive advantage lays predominately in two main factors: the quality of the product and its price. Achieving high-quality levels and the highest nutritional standards might benefit considerably the enterprise’ business growth. Even though each product might require to meet specific nutritional standards, there are some that might be recommended across the food chain, for instance: level of calories based on the ranges defined by the Dietary Reference Intakes (DRIs), low content of saturated and trans fat, no added sugar, low content of additives, rich in fiber, minerals, vitamins and proteins. The national departments or ministries of health, education or agriculture tend to define and recommend specific nutritional standards for each product that the enterprise should know to ensure its compliance (Cardello, 1995; FAO, 2013)."

Food contamination should be avoided; implementing control measures enables the enterprise to prevent and combat any situation that might lead to food contamination. Food safety has a direct impact on consumers’ health, as well as on the employees that are in direct contact with the food ingredients. An integrated approach to ensure food safety requires a strong cooperation by the food industry and chain stakeholders in order to build consumers trust and confidence. The enterprise requires investing in education programmes, preventive measures and adoption of adequate practices. A food safety hazard is a biological, chemical or physical agent in, or condition of, food with the potential to cause an adverse health effect. Some examples include improper use of agricultural chemicals (i.e. insecticides, fungicides, herbicides, fertilizers), metal and rock fragments, the appearance of virus, bacteria and parasites and the use of genetically-modified organisms that have been proven to be harmful.

                    "Product labelling is an essential part of transparent accountability to consumers. According to the Codex Alimentarius Commission (COD EX STAN 1-1985), “Labeling means any written, printed or graphic matter that is present on the label, accompanies the food, or is displayed near the food, including that for the purpose of promoting its sale or disposal.” Information usually provides details on the content and composition of products but also particular aspects of the product, such as its origin, or its production method, including whether it has been produced using a certified organic production or other methods. Some foodstuffs, such as those containing genetically modified organisms or allergenic substances, especially foods intended for infants or even various beverages, are subject to specific regulations. Labelling may also identify value-based systems, such as whether goods have been produced using a certified fair trade system. Labelling of certain non-food products must also contain particular information such as toxicity, hazard and flammability, to guarantee their safe use and allow consumers to exercise real choice. In addition, the packaging of foodstuffs must adhere to production criteria to avoid contaminating food products with both food and nonfood contaminants. Labelling must be genuine, and in the best systems, this is independently verified, such as an organic certification or fair trade certificate. Therefore, labelling and claims vary from ethical and nutritional, through safety and production process characteristics and can include the mundane, such as origin through to whether the food is the result of genetic engineering. The standard is that labels must be clear, honest and verifiable (FAO, 2013; Boström et al., 2008)."

                    "A traceability system is a series of mechanisms and procedures that ensure traceability over all stages of the food chain so that products can be easily and correctly identified and recalled. The Codex Alimentarius Commission (COD EX STAN 1-1985) defines traceability as “the ability to follow the movement of a food through specified stage(s) of production, processing and distribution”. The “ability to follow the movement” refers to tracing both directions: trace forward in the food chain and trace backward in the food chain. Furthermore, “movement” can relate to the origin of the materials, processing history or distribution. Traceability systems could be composed of rules and documented procedures, organizational structures, processes and management resources (i.e. personnel, financial resources, equipment, information technologies), regulations and training. A traceability system can also use information system technologies for electronic data entry and database management systems. Traceability systems improve management of risks related to food safety, guarantees products authenticity and give reliable information to customers. New legal requirements in many developed and developing countries increase pressure on exporting countries to comply with traceability requirements and especially, with those included in the World Trade Organization agreements, to justify sanitary or phytosanitary objectives. Additionally, traceability is a requirement in all B2B voluntary certifiable standards in good agricultural and manufacturing practices, including  HACC P principles. There are two main international standards and guidelines that regulate the establishment and operation of a traceability system: ISO 9001: 2000, a standard for quality management and quality assurance; and ISO 22000: 2005, a standard for food safety and management systems. In the case of forest products, it is important to track the chain of custody of all types of products to ensure that they originated from sustainably managed forests verifiable (Moe, 2008; FAO, 2013)."

Food contamination should be avoided; implementing control measures enables the enterprise to prevent and combat any situation that might lead to food contamination. Food safety has a direct impact on consumers’ health, as well as on the employees that are in direct contact with the food ingredients. An integrated approach to ensure food safety requires a strong cooperation by the food industry and chain stakeholders in order to build consumers trust and confidence. The enterprise requires investing in education programmes, preventive measures and adoption of adequate practices. A food safety hazard is a biological, chemical or physical agent in, or condition of, food with the potential to cause an adverse health effect. Some examples include improper use of agricultural chemicals (i.e. insecticides, fungicides, herbicides, fertilizers), metal and rock fragments, the appearance of virus, bacteria and parasites and the use of genetically-modified organisms that have been proven to be harmful.

According to the Codex Alimentarius Commission (COD EX STAN 1-1985), “Labeling means any written, printed or graphic matter that is present on the label, accompanies the food, or is displayed near the food, including that for the purpose of promoting its sale or disposal.” Information usually provides details on the content and composition of products but also particular aspects of the product, such as its origin, or its production method, including whether it has been produced using a certified organic production or other methods. Some foodstuffs, such as those containing genetically modified organisms or allergenic substances, especially foods intended for infants or even various beverages, are subject to specific regulations. Labelling may also identify value-based systems, such as whether goods have been produced using a certified fair trade system. Labelling of certain non-food products must also contain particular information such as toxicity, hazard and flammability, to guarantee their safe use and allow consumers to exercise real choice. In addition, the packaging of foodstuffs must adhere to production criteria to avoid contaminating food products with both food and nonfood contaminants. Labelling must be genuine, and in the best systems, this is independently verified, such as an organic certification or fair trade certificate. Therefore, labelling and claims vary from ethical and nutritional, through safety and production process characteristics and can include the mundane, such as origin through to whether the food is the result of genetic engineering. The standard is that labels must be clear, honest and verifiable (FAO, 2013; Boström et al., 2008)."

                    "A traceability system is a series of mechanisms and procedures that ensure traceability over all stages of the food chain so that products can be easily and correctly identified and recalled. The Codex Alimentarius Commission (COD EX STAN 1-1985) defines traceability as “the ability to follow the movement of a food through specified stage(s) of production, processing and distribution”. The “ability to follow the movement” refers to tracing both directions: trace forward in the food chain and trace backward in the food chain. Furthermore, “movement” can relate to the origin of the materials, processing history or distribution. Traceability systems could be composed of rules and documented procedures, organizational structures, processes and management resources (i.e. personnel, financial resources, equipment, information technologies), regulations and training. A traceability system can also use information system technologies for electronic data entry and database management systems. Traceability systems improve management of risks related to food safety, guarantees products authenticity and give reliable information to customers. New legal requirements in many developed and developing countries increase pressure on exporting countries to comply with traceability requirements and especially, with those included in the World Trade Organization agreements, to justify sanitary or phytosanitary objectives. Additionally, traceability is a requirement in all B2B voluntary certifiable standards in good agricultural and manufacturing practices, including  HACC P principles. There are two main international standards and guidelines that regulate the establishment and operation of a traceability system: ISO 9001: 2000, a standard for quality management and quality assurance; and ISO 22000: 2005, a standard for food safety and management systems. In the case of forest products, it is important to track the chain of custody of all types of products to ensure that they originated from sustainably managed forests verifiable (Moe, 2008; FAO, 2013)."

There has been recent focus in the literature on food redistribution between different agents along the supply chain, mostly in the hospitality and retail sector using different transformative mechanisms and via a number of channels from the more traditional to online collaborative platforms and other ICT-enabled modes (Falcone P.M., Imbert E. 2017, Bringing a Sharing Economy Approach into the Food Sector: The Potential of Food Sharing for Reducing Food Waste. In: Morone P., Papendiek F., Tartiu V. (eds) Food Waste Reduction and Valorisation, Springer). Food redistribution has not only economic and environmental benefits but also food security and social impacts, and thus any approach to redistribution has to be aligned with the social justice context. Food surplus redistribution may lead to social inclusion benefits and be central to the nexus of waste reduction, social inclusion, and community engagement (Schanes, K. and Stagl, S. 2018. Food waste fighters: What motives people to engage in food sharing?. Journal of Cleaner Production 211, 1491-1501)."

Technically, the price of food is the sum of all the values that a customer gives up to gain the benefits of having or using the food in question. Thus, consumers exchange a certain value for having or using the product. That value is called price. Price has been the major factor affecting buyer choice. However, in recent decades, non-price factors (e.g., the origin and the healthiness of the food) have gained increasing importance. Food prices are affected by several factors such as the cost of inputs, labour, transport, processing, marketing, weather, market speculation, and food demand (Köster, 2009; Swinnen, 2011)."

Competition-based pricing is a pricing method that makes use of competitors' prices for the same or similar product as a basis in setting a price. The business may sell its product at a price above or below such a benchmark. Setting a price above the benchmark will result in higher profit per unit but may also result in fewer units sold, as customers would prefer products with lower prices. On the other hand, setting a price below the benchmark might result in more units sold but will cause less profit per unit. The cost-based pricing method consists of adding the direct material cost, the direct labour cost, and overhead to determine what it costs the company to offer the product or service. Then, a markup percentage is added to the total cost to determine the selling price. This markup percentage is profit (Hinterhuber, 2008; Johansson et al., 2012)."

Special-event pricing consists in offering discounts and rebates on festivals, during the off-seasons with the intention to pull as many customers as possible. Cash rebates consist in offering the cash rebates on their items if purchased in a particular time period. In the case of loss-leader pricing, big retailers reduce the price of a well-known brand with the intention to have additional store traffic. Through this strategy, the retailers try to compensate for their margin loss from the additional sales achieved from additional customers. Warranties and service contracts consist in offering extended warranties and free services of the product to the customers. Finally, under psychological discounting, the companies artificially set the high price of the product and then offer it at substantial savings (Kendrick, 1998; Kaser, 2012)."

Convenience food includes a range of products like noodles, soup, frozen vegetables, casserole mixes, dessert mixes and yoghurts.  To measure the WTP for convenience, first, the attribute convenience of the studied food product needs to be defined. Then, two products one with the attribute convenience and one without this attribute should be identified and valued. The price premium for convenience is the difference between the willingness to pay for the food with the attribute convenience and the food without this attribute (e.g., Ready to eat lasagne versus frozen and not cooked lasagne) (Lyly et al., 2007; Ikiz et al., 2018)."

                    "Taxes and bans are tools used by governments to discourage the production of and/or the demand for food products with undesirable attributes (e.g., unhealthy foods, non-ethical products and farming practices). Food tax is a surcharge, generally, applied to food products whose consumptions has negatives externalities (e.g., obesity, pollution, addiction). The food tax helps to decrease the consumption of food products with undesirable attributes by increasing their prices.  Furthermore, the money raised through food taxes is generally used by the government to pay for the social cost caused by the consumption of the taxed food. Fat and sugar taxes are among the well-known food taxes that were applied to encourage healthy choices (Bertail and Nichèle, 2010); 2010; Escobar et al., 2013). Bans constitute another tool used by governments to stop the use of farming and processing practices that were proven to have negatives externalities on the public, farm animals, and the environment. For example, bans, such as banning the use of gestation crate (pigs), battery cages (hens), and castration (lamb), were used in the EU to improve the welfare of animals raised in modern EU farms. The trans-fat ban is another example of the use of bans to reduce the consumption of food products with unhealthy attributes. In fact, by the mid-2000s, it was clear beyond doubt that trans-fats increase the risk of coronary heart disease. Denmark banned partially hydrogenated oils in 2003, and several other countries followed suit; in the United States, New York City passed such a ban for restaurant foods in 2006, and the state of California did the same in 2008 (Downs et al., 2013)."

                    "Demand analysis has been commonly used to assess the effect of taxes on the demand for the taxed food products. Price elasticity is the main output of demand analysis. It measures the percentage change in the demand of the studied product following one per cent change in its price. For example, if the price elasticity of a product A is equal to -2.5, this suggests that an increase in the price of product A by 1% will lead to a decrease in it demand by 2.5%. This also implies that if the price of product A increases by, for example, 10% following the application of a tax, its demand will decrease by 25% (=2.5*10%). There are two types of price elasticity: own-price elasticity and cross-price elasticity. While the own-price elasticity measures the sensitivity of demand for product A to a change in its price, the cross-price elasticity measures the change in the demand for product A to a change in the price of product B. Information on cross-price elasticity is useful to assess how taxing a food product will affect its substitutes and complementary products. For instance, taxing soft drinks may decrease its consumption but may also increase the demand for juice, if juice and soft drinks are complementary products (Gramer et al., 2001; Lin et al., 2011)."

                    "They are generally financial incentives given by the government to individuals or businesses in the form of cash, grants, or tax breaks with the aim of keeping the prices of food products low for people to be able to afford them and also to encourage their production in the first place. Subsidies are the most popular income support policy (Callan et al., 1998; Schwartz and Clements, 1999). There are at least four types of subsidies. 1. Production subsidy is provided to encourage the production and consumption of a product. In order for manufacturers to increase their production output, the government compensates for some of its parts to lessen their expense while increasing their output. As a result, production and consumption grow, but the price remains the same. The drawback of such an incentive though is that it promotes overproduction and incurs the cost for product storage. 2. Consumption subsidy happens when the government offsets the costs of food, education, healthcare, and water.  3. Export subsidy consists of encouraging exports by subsidising the cost. However, this can be easily abused, especially, by exporters who exaggerate the prices of their goods so that they receive a larger incentive, eventually raising their profits at the expense of the government’s spending. 4. Employment subsidy is given by the government to companies and organisations in order to enable them to provide more job opportunities. Perhaps the most popular in the EU is the Common Agricultural Policy CAP, which is a system of subsidies paid to EU farmers. Its main purposes are to guarantee minimum levels of production so that Europeans have enough food to eat and to ensure a fair standard of living for those dependent on agriculture (Gray, 2000). In developing countries, income support policies are heavily used to reduce food insecurity and malnutrition. Maize, rice, wheat, sugar, and cooking oil are the most subsidised food products in developing countries (Besley and Kanbur, 1988). There is an increasing body of literature on the negative effect of the use of subsidies. It seems that the use of subsidies harms the environment, distorts trade, and benefits those in society who do not require support (Rivas, 2003)."

                    "Several approaches have been proposed to measure the effect of income support policies (see for example, Cerulli (2010)). As aforementioned, one of the main objectives of income support policies is to increase (directly or indirectly) individuals’ income. An easy way to assess the sensitivity of the demand for food products to a change in consumer income is to estimate the income elasticities of these products. The income elasticity measures the percentage change in the demand for a product following a change in consumer income. For example, if the income elasticity of fruit and vegetables is equal to 1.6, this implies that an increase of consumer income by 1% will increase the consumption of fruit and vegetables by 1.6% (Gramer et al., 2001; Haque, 2006)."
