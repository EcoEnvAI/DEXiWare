GHG emissions intensities can be: (i) derived through application of a life cycle assessment (LCA) to specific crop cultivation stages, most simply by using an open source footprint calculator such as the Cool farm Tool (https://coolfarmtool.org/) or AgreCalc (https://www.agrecalc.com/); (ii) obtained from secondary sources, including LCA (e.g. Ecoinvent & AgriFootprint) databases and published food LCA studies (e.g. Poore and Nemecek 2018).", "Results should be expressed per tonne (Mg) of dry matter (DM) of the main product, to ensure standardized units. This may require knowledge of moisture content at harvest, and possibly also allocation of crop cultivation burdens across multiple co-products (e.g. grain and straw) based on relative economic values. GHG emissions should be aggregated as kg CO2 equivalent based on IPCC (2013) global warming potentials over a 100-year timeframe (GWP100). Changes in soil C stocks may be included in net emissions balances, as per standard reporting guidelines for land use and land use change emissions (BSI 2011; IPCC 2006b).", "Note that for this and all subsequent environment metrics, harvested products include co-products (e.g. straw) alongside the main product (e.g. grain) harvested from the cropping system."],

The distance travelled is therefore not a useful indicator of sustainability, given that e.g. tomatoes imported to the UK in winter have a lower environmental footprint than tomatoes grown in heated greenhouses in the UK (Antonopoulos et al. 2014). The mode of transport strongly influences environmental impact, with air freight generating up to 500 times more CO2 eq. per tonne.km travelled than ocean transport over long distances (DEFRA 2019). Therefore, we propose mode of transport, and local vs global transport, as two important components of environmental sustainability (local supply chains within Europe are likely to be subject to higher levels of environmental regulation than global supply chains). Where products comprise multiple ingredients, this metric relates to the most environmentally intensive mode across any of the ingredients accounting for more than 10% by mass of the final product(s)."],

According to the Codex Alimentarius Commission (COD EX STAN 1-1985), “Labeling means any written, printed or graphic matter that is present on the label, accompanies the food, or is displayed near the food, including that for the purpose of promoting its sale or disposal.” Information usually provides details on the content and composition of products but also particular aspects of the product, such as its origin, or its production method, including whether it has been produced using a certified organic production or other methods. Some foodstuffs, such as those containing genetically modified organisms or allergenic substances, especially foods intended for infants or even various beverages, are subject to specific regulations. Labelling may also identify value-based systems, such as whether goods have been produced using a certified fair trade system. Labelling of certain non-food products must also contain particular information such as toxicity, hazard and flammability, to guarantee their safe use and allow consumers to exercise real choice. In addition, the packaging of foodstuffs must adhere to production criteria to avoid contaminating food products with both food and nonfood contaminants. Labelling must be genuine, and in the best systems, this is independently verified, such as an organic certification or fair trade certificate. Therefore, labelling and claims vary from ethical and nutritional, through safety and production process characteristics and can include the mundane, such as origin through to whether the food is the result of genetic engineering. The standard is that labels must be clear, honest and verifiable (FAO, 2013; Boström et al., 2008)."],

The “ability to follow the movement” refers to tracing both directions: trace forward in the food chain and trace backward in the food chain. Furthermore, “movement” can relate to the origin of the materials, processing history or distribution. Traceability systems could be composed of rules and documented procedures, organizational structures, processes and management resources (i.e. personnel, financial resources, equipment, information technologies), regulations and training. A traceability system can also use information system technologies for electronic data entry and database management systems. Traceability systems improve management of risks related to food safety, guarantees products authenticity and give reliable information to customers. New legal requirements in many developed and developing countries increase pressure on exporting countries to comply with traceability requirements and especially, with those included in the World Trade Organization agreements, to justify sanitary or phytosanitary objectives. Additionally, traceability is a requirement in all B2B voluntary certifiable standards in good agricultural and manufacturing practices, including  HACC P principles. There are two main international standards and guidelines that regulate the establishment and operation of a traceability system: ISO 9001: 2000, a standard for quality management and quality assurance; and ISO 22000: 2005, a standard for food safety and", "management systems.

Food redistribution has not only economic and environmental benefits but also food security and social impacts, and thus any approach to redistribution has to be aligned with the social justice context. Food surplus redistribution may lead to social inclusion benefits and be central to the nexus of waste reduction, social inclusion, and community engagement (Schanes, K. and Stagl, S. 2018. Food waste fighters: What motives people to engage in food sharing?. Journal of Cleaner Production 211, 1491-1501)."],

Technically, the price of food is the sum of all the values that a customer gives up to gain the benefits of having or using the food in question. Thus, consumers exchange a certain value for having or using the product. That value is called price. Price has been the major factor affecting buyer choice. However, in recent decades, non-price factors (e.g., the origin and the healthiness of the food) have gained increasing importance. Food prices are affected by several factors such as the cost of inputs, labour, transport, processing, marketing, weather, market speculation, and food demand (Köster, 2009; Swinnen, 2011)."],
            "METRICS": ["Two main methods are used to figure out what price to attach to each unit of a food product: competition-based pricing and cost-based pricing. Competition-based pricing is a pricing method that makes use of competitors' prices for the same or similar product as a basis in setting a price. The business may sell its product at a price above or below such a benchmark. Setting a price above the benchmark will result in higher profit per unit but may also result in fewer units sold, as customers would prefer products with lower prices. On the other hand, setting a price below the benchmark might result in more units sold but will cause less profit per unit. The cost-based pricing method consists of adding the direct material cost, the direct labour cost, and overhead to determine what it costs the company to offer the product or service. Then, a markup percentage is added to the total cost to determine the selling price. This markup percentage is profit (Hinterhuber, 2008; Johansson et al., 2012)."],

Companies adopt several promotional pricing schemes such as special-event pricing, cash rebates, warranties and service contracts, and psychological discounting. Special-event pricing consists in offering discounts and rebates on festivals, during the off-seasons with the intention to pull as many customers as possible. Cash rebates consist in offering the cash rebates on their items if purchased in a particular time period. In the case of loss-leader pricing, big retailers reduce the price of a well-known brand with the intention to have additional store traffic. Through this strategy, the retailers try to compensate for their margin loss from the additional sales achieved from additional customers. Warranties and service contracts consist in offering extended warranties and free services of the product to the customers. Finally, under psychological discounting, the companies artificially set the high price of the product and then offer it at substantial savings (Kendrick, 1998; Kaser, 2012)."],

Food tax is a surcharge, generally, applied to food products whose consumptions has negatives externalities (e.g., obesity, pollution, addiction). The food tax helps to decrease the consumption of food products with undesirable attributes by increasing their prices.  Furthermore, the money raised through food taxes is generally used by the government to pay for the social cost caused by the consumption of the taxed food. Fat and sugar taxes are among the well-known food taxes that were applied to encourage healthy choices (Bertail and Nichèle, 2010); 2010; Escobar et al., 2013).", "Bans constitute another tool used by governments to stop the use of farming and processing practices that were proven to have negatives externalities on the public, farm animals, and the environment. For example, bans, such as banning the use of gestation crate (pigs), battery cages (hens), and castration (lamb), were used in the EU to improve the welfare of animals raised in modern EU farms. The trans-fat ban is another example of the use of bans to reduce the consumption of food products with unhealthy attributes. In fact, by the mid-2000s, it was clear beyond doubt that trans-fats increase the risk of coronary heart disease. Denmark banned partially hydrogenated oils in 2003, and several other countries followed suit; in the United States, New York City passed such a ban for restaurant foods in 2006, and the state of California did the same in 2008 (Downs et al., 2013)."],
            "METRICS": ["Demand analysis has been commonly used to assess the effect of taxes on the demand for the taxed food products. Price elasticity is the main output of demand analysis. It measures the percentage change in the demand of the studied product following one per cent change in its price. For example, if the price elasticity of a product A is equal to -2.5, this suggests that an increase in the price of product A by 1% will lead to a decrease in it demand by 2.5%. This also implies that if the price of product A increases by, for example, 10% following the application of a tax, its demand will decrease by 25% (=2.5*10%). There are two types of price elasticity: own-price elasticity and cross-price elasticity. While the own-price elasticity measures the sensitivity of demand for product A to a change in its price, the cross-price elasticity measures the change in the demand for product A to a change in the price of product B. Information on cross-price elasticity is useful to assess how taxing a food product will affect its substitutes and complementary products.

Subsidies are the most popular income support policy (Callan et al., 1998; Schwartz and Clements, 1999). There are at least four types of subsidies.", "1. Production subsidy is provided to encourage the production and consumption of a product. In order for manufacturers to increase their production output, the government compensates for some of its parts to lessen their expense while increasing their output. As a result, production and consumption grow, but the price remains the same. The drawback of such an incentive though is that it promotes overproduction and incurs the cost for product storage.", "2. Consumption subsidy happens when the government offsets the costs of food, education, healthcare, and water.", "3. Export subsidy consists of encouraging exports by subsidising the cost. However, this can be easily abused, especially, by exporters who exaggerate the prices of their goods so that they receive a larger incentive, eventually raising their profits at the expense of the government’s spending.", "4. Employment subsidy is given by the government to companies and organisations in order to enable them to provide more job opportunities.", "Perhaps the most popular in the EU is the Common Agricultural Policy CAP, which is a system of subsidies paid to EU farmers. Its main purposes are to guarantee minimum levels of production so that Europeans have enough food to eat and to ensure a fair standard of living for those dependent on agriculture (Gray, 2000).", "In developing countries, income support policies are heavily used to reduce food insecurity and malnutrition. Maize, rice, wheat, sugar, and cooking oil are the most subsidised food products in developing countries (Besley and Kanbur, 1988).", "There is an increasing body of literature on the negative effect of the use of subsidies. It seems that the use of subsidies harms the environment, distorts trade, and benefits those in society who do not require support (Rivas, 2003)."],
            "METRICS": ["Several approaches have been proposed to measure the effect of income support policies (see for example, Cerulli (2010)). As aforementioned, one of the main objectives of income support policies is to increase (directly or indirectly) individuals’ income. An easy way to assess the sensitivity of the demand for food products to a change in consumer income is to estimate the income elasticities of these products. The income elasticity measures the percentage change in the demand for a product following a change in consumer income. For example, if the income elasticity of fruit and vegetables is equal to 1.6, this implies that an increase of consumer income by 1% will increase the consumption of fruit and vegetables by 1.6% (Gramer et al., 2001; Haque, 2006)."],
